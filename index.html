  <h2>Abstract</h2>
 <p> <strong>Objectives:</strong> This study investigated how non-implantable Softband Bone Conduction Hearing Aids (SBCHAs) are prescribed for children with conductive hearing loss (CHL) across a single Health Board. Key areas explored included: </p> <ul> <li>Referral pathways</li> <li>Hearing loss severity</li> <li>Clinical justifications for prescribing</li> <li>Consistency of decision-making without formal guidelines</li> </ul> <p> <strong>Methods:</strong> A retrospective service evaluation was carried out across four hospital sites. Clinical records from October 2019 to October 2024 were reviewed, including 28 children fitted with SBCHAs. Data collected included: </p> <ul> <li>Age at fitting</li> <li>Type and severity of hearing loss</li> <li>Associated medical conditions</li> <li>Clinical reasoning and ENT referral history</li> </ul> <p> <strong>Results:</strong> <ul> <li>Significant variation in SBCHA prescribing practices was found.</li> <li>In several cases, clinical justifications were unclear or missing.</li> <li>ENT referrals were sometimes absent or undocumented, even when indicated.</li> <li>For temporary hearing loss (e.g., otitis media with effusion), observation periods prior to device fitting were often not documented.</li> <li>Alternative management options were inconsistently recorded.</li> </ul> </p> <p> <strong>Limitations:</strong> The evaluation was limited by its retrospective design, small sample size, and inconsistent quality of clinical records. The lack of outcome data and incomplete information on alternative treatments restricted assessment of long-term effectiveness. </p> <p> <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Prescribing practices for SBCHAs within the Health Board are inconsistent and not always clearly documented. Introducing local prescribing guidelines, structured documentation, and regular review processes could improve consistency and transparency. A decision-making framework was developed from these findings to support more consistent practice in paediatric settings. </p>
